  <h2 class="content-title">WE HANDLE ALL YOUR NEEDS</h2>
 <p>There is no need to worry when we are here to help,You can get all products of your choice ,quality and uantity is our prime moto.
  A customer need is a motive that prompts a customer to buy a product or service. Ultimately, the need is the driver of the customer's purchase decision. Companies often look at the customer need as an opportunity to resolve or contribute surplus value back to the original motive.
  The first step to identifying customer needs is with a customer needs analysis that takes all of the following into account: product-market fit, customer feedback, input from your service team, and any customer service data you can gather. From there, you'll be able to identify customer needs as well as any friction that exists in your process.
